# Leaply

This is an open-source rewrite of the [Leaply](https://leap.ly) opportunities
platform. It is a work-in-progress and not currently in use at the link above.
Once feature parity is reached we will transition to it.

The goals of this project are as follows:

- Open source our codebase for transparency and reliability
- Redesign the visual aspect of the site
- Increase maintainability of the codebase
- Improve on the scalability of the platform

## Development Usage

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
